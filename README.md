Spring 2024 Semester Project for ATLAS VR

# Downloading
Clone repository to a specific directory using Github Desktop, or by entering `git clone https://github.com/ATLAS-Illinois/ATLASQuadProject/tree/mammoth [path-to-file]` on the Terminal, which by default should be the path to your username file `C:\Users\[username]`.

# Initializing Quad Project
Open the ATLASQuadProject using Unity Hub, installing the Unity version compatible with it if necessary. To initialize the project itself, go to Scenes in the Assets folder and drag the scene called QuadProject to the Hierarchy, removing the previous scene. 

<sub> **Note:** There's a NotQuadProject in the Scenes folder. It's completely empty but I am not sure whether or not it can be deleted. </sub>
